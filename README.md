ðŸŽ“ CS50 2023 â€“ Problem Sets (Weeks 0â€“7)

A curated collection of my solutions to Harvardâ€™s CS50 2023 problem sets, showcasing my progress from visual programming with Scratch to more advanced topics in C, Python, and SQL.
Each week builds upon the previous one â€” covering fundamentals of programming, algorithmic thinking, memory management, and data handling â€” forming a solid foundation in computer science.

ðŸ“š Topics Covered

Week 0: Scratch â€“ logic, event-driven programming, and problem decomposition

Week 1: C â€“ syntax, variables, conditionals, loops, and compilation workflow

Week 2: Arrays â€“ strings, loops, and introductory algorithms (searching & sorting)

Week 3: Algorithms â€“ efficiency, recursion, and sorting algorithms (selection, bubble, merge)

Week 4: Memory â€“ pointers, dynamic memory (malloc, free), and valgrind debugging

Week 5: Data Structures â€“ linked lists, hash tables, and tries

Week 6: Python â€“ data types, loops, file I/O, exceptions, and object-oriented programming

Week 7: SQL â€“ relational databases, SELECT queries, filtering, aggregation, and joins

ðŸ›  Technologies & Tools

Languages: Scratch, C, Python, SQL

Compiler / Interpreter: clang, python3, sqlite3

Version Control: Git & GitHub

Debugging Tools: debug50, valgrind, print debugging

Environment: CS50 IDE (Linux-based terminal)
